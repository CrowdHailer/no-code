# No Code

No Code is just the on trend name for programming without a text editor.
Previous names to capture the same idea include:

- Visual programming
- task/IT automation


- [Programming Models](programming-models)
- [Deployment](deployment)

## Programming Models

### Spreadsheet++

### Task automation
Automation builder

### Flow based programming

https://noflojs.org/
https://nodered.org/

Often used to describe programming models that work at a low level, down to integer operation.
These low level abstractions should probably not be considered no-code.

### Visual programming

https://www.luna-lang.org/

Not really a new paradigm, just another representation.
Luna even allows both a visual and textual representation

## Deployment

Most paid for No Code platforms handle execution on the program.
however there is no reason a No Code system cannot generate a bundle for any other kind of deployment,
e.g. a JS bundle for the front end or a binary for server deployment.

TODO write reference to serverless
